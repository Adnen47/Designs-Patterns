#Interfaces:
In object-oriented programming, an interface is a set of public method signatures of an object.

* Prevents the application programmer (who uses a class) from manipulating the object in an improper way, since the only possible modifications of an instance are those indicated as public by the designer of the class.
* Allows the class programmer to modify the internal implementation of these methods transparently.


#Designs Patterns :

* Decorator:
The purpose of the Decorator pattern is to dynamically add additional functionality to an object ...
The Decorator class also implements a method. It holds an attribute that contains a reference to a component. 
The latter is passed as a parameter to the Decorator constructor. 
* Facade:
The objective of the Facade pattern is to group the interfaces of a set of objects into a unified interface making this set easier to ... 
* Iterator:
The Iterator pattern provides sequential access to a collection ... 
* Observer:
The objective of the Observer pattern is to build a dependence between a subject ... 
* Strategy:
The Strategy pattern aims to adapt the behavior and algorithms of an object according to a need without changing the interactions of this object with customers ...
* Singleton:
The Singleton pattern is intended to ensure that a class has only one instance and to provide a single class method ...
* Prototype:
The purpose of the pattern is the creation of new objects ...
* Factory Method:
The purpose of the Factory Method pattern is to introduce a method ...
* Abstract Factory:
The purpose of the Abstract Factory pattern is the creation of grouped objects ... 
* MVC (Model View Controller):
A model contains the data to be displayed.
A View contains the presentation of the graphical interface.
A Controller contains logic for actions performed by the user.
* Middleware:
A middleware designates an element which will be placed between the request received by the server and the returned response.
* Adapter:
It converts the interface of a class into another interface that the client expects.
